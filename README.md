## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Airbnb [Seattle Open Data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) from Jan 2016 to Jan 2017 to answer following business questions:

1. Which kinds of accomodations are listed and how do they make up the price?
2. Does the number of reviewer comments have an impact on the popularity of the objects in the given period?
3. Which accommodations of which host were actually booked in the given period and which ones generated the most revenue?

To clone the repository use: git clone

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There 3 csv files used for the analysis are downloaded from kaggle.
